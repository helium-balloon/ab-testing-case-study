          <h3>Metrics</h3>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>
              <b>Misclick Rate</b> - the frequency with which users click
              something else on the page before finding the correct button for
              the task
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Time on Page</b> - time spent on the webpage for each user
              group
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Number of Clicks</b> - how many times users clicked on the page
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            My metric of choice is the number of clicks users used to complete
            the task. I chose this because I noticed that there was a large
            variety of clicks used to complete the task, especially in the A
            task, and I wanted to see what the data looked like comparing the
            two in terms of clicks. In addition, I think that this is a useful
            metric because if it takes less clicks, then it can be easier for
            the user to complete.

          <h3>Null and Alternative Hypotheses</h3>
          <ul class="list">
            <li><b>Misclick Rate</b></li>
            <li style="list-style-type: none">
              <ul class="circle">
                <li>
                  <i>Null Hypothesis -</i> The misclick rate is the same in
                  sample A and sample B.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Alternative Hypothesis -</i> The misclick rate from sample
                  A is greater than the misclick rate from sample B.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Justification - </i>I made this alternative hypothesis
                  because in version A, no one knew how the website worked and
                  it was a confusing interface so more people were more likely
                  to misclick. However, in version B, the interface was more
                  clear and understandable, so it is likely that there was a
                  smaller misclick rate.

                  <i>Null Hypothesis -</i> The time spent on page is the same in

                <li>
                  <i>Alternative Hypothesis -</i> The time spent on page is

                <li>
                  <i>Justification -</i> I made this alternative hypothesis
                  because in version A, people are more likely to make mistakes
                  because the interface is new and confusing, leading them to
                  spend more time on the page especially if they misclick and
                  make mistakes. On the other hand, if version B is easier to
                  use and understand, users will be able to complete the task in
                  a shorter amount of time because the steps are more clear.

                  <i>Justification -</i> I made this alternative hypothesis
                  because in version A, people are more likely to make mistakes
                  and end up clicking multiple things, especially wrong things,
                  which will increase the number of clicks. On the other hand,
                  in version B, people will be more likely to find what they are
                  looking for and click a smaller amount of times to get there
                  because the interface is more intuitive and easier to
                  understand through making the buttons and hospital locations
                  more readable.

          <h3>Predictions</h3>
          <ul class="list">
            <li><b>Misclick Rate</b></li>

                  I believe that I will end up rejecting the null hypothesis
                  based on the data. In the data from Version A, about one half
                  of people misclicked at least once during their attempt.
                  However, during Version B testing, no users misclicked.
                  Through testing this data, I expect that the p-value will
                  indicate that the difference between these two findings is
                  significant. Because of this, I expect to reject the null
                  hypothesis that the misclick rate for Version A and Version B
                  are the same.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Time on Page</b></li>

                  I believe that I will end up rejecting the null hypothesis
                  after looking at the data for each version. From version A
                  testing, the majority of data points are over 20,000
                  milliseconds. However, in Version B testing, the users rarely
                  exceeded 10,000 milliseconds on the page. Due to this large
                  difference I witnessed in the data, I expect that through the
                  tests, the p-value will indicate that the amount of decrease
                  in time on page from Version A to Version B is significant .
                  Thus, I expect to reject the null hypothesis which states that
                  the time on page in Version A and Version B is the same.

                <li>
                  I believe that I will end up rejecting the null hypothesis
                  through viewing the data from each version. I noticed that in
                  the version A data, there was a large difference in the number
                  of clicks different people took to complete the task, ranging
                  from 2 to 26. On the other hand, in the Version B data, there
                  was little variability in the number of clicks, as people only
                  used 2-4 clicks. Because of this large difference in the
                  number of clicks used in the different versions, I believe
                  that the p-value will indicate that the amount of decrease in
                  the number of clicks from Version A to Version B is
                  significant. Through this, I expect to reject the null
                  hypothesis which states that the number of clicks in Version A
                  and Version B is the same.

        <h2>Statistical Tests</h2>

          <h3>Misclick Rate</h3>
          <div class="half">
            <p>
              For the misclick rate, I chose to run a chi squared test because
              misclick can be represented as a boolean value which can be split
              into two categories: did misclick and did not misclick. In sample
              A, 12 users misclicked and 12 users did not misclick. In sample B,
              0 users misclicked and 22 users did not misclick. As seen in the
              table, the degrees of freedom for this metric is 1, the chi^2
              value is 14.88, and the p-value is 0.0001. <br /><br />

              Because the p-value<=0.05, we find that the difference between
              versions A and B with respect to misclick rate is significant. We
              can come to the same conclusion through using the chi square
              statistic as well, which is 14.88. We know that we have 1 degree
              of freedom, so using the critical value of the chi-square
              distribution where alpha=0.05, the chi-square critical value is
              3.841. Because the chi^2 statistic, 14.88, is greater than the
              critical value, 3.841, the magnitude of difference between the two
              groups is significant. <br /><br />

              Because the p-value is significant and the chi-square statistic is
              significant, we find statistically significant evidence that the
              alternative hypothesis is true.
